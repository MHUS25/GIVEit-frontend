# GIVEit-frontend  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MugeHasilci/GIVEit-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/becc-mu/GIVEit-frontend)

This is a 2-week final project we undertook at Makers.

Here is a link to our app in production: http://giveit.surge.sh/

## Features

Our app has the following features:
 - Signing up
 - Logging in / out
 - Creating, showing, updating and deleting listings

## Initial User Stories

These are the user stories we wrote to get ourselves started with the project and reach our MVP (we completed this by the end of the second day).

`````
As a user
So that I can make a request for help
I want to create a listing

As a user
So that I can find help on a map
I want to see the listing location on Google Maps

``````
